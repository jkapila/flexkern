## This is an experimental lab for Flexible Kernel based Unsupervised Learning

# The ideology behind this library is Obejective -> Learner -> Controller for Unsupervised learning


Will implement following:
1) Different Distance Metrices
2) Plug-in Unsupervised Learning Methods :
    a) K-Nearest Neighbours
    b) K - Means Clustering
    c) Agglomerative Clustering (Hierarchical Clustering)
    d) Gaussian Mixter Models
    e) Linear Vector Quantization
    f) SVM Based Learning
    g) Kernel based Adaptive Clustering
    h) Expectation Maximisation
    j) Hidden Markov Models
    k) Neural Networks
3) Objective Function <- Learner Function <- Controllers Architecture
4) Bayesian Methods for Tuning and Behavioural Analysis
5) Model Storing and Retrieving
6) Simulations for Pattern Behaviours

# This is supposedily a big task. All are cordially invited to contribute to this library
